# Logical Operators

## Overview
Implement logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`).

- `&&`: logical AND (short-circuit)
- `||`: logical OR (short-circuit)
- `!`: logical NOT (unary operator)

### Precedence
- `!` (unary): Level 1 (highest)
- `&&`: Level 6
- `||`: Level 7

### Short-circuit Evaluation
`&&` and `||` perform short-circuit evaluation. If the left side determines the result, the right side is not evaluated.
