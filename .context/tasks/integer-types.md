# Remaining Integer Types

## Overview
Implement the remaining integer types.

### Types
| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `int` | Signed integer (platform default size) |
| `uint` | Unsigned integer (platform default size) |
| `i8` | 8-bit signed integer |
| `i16` | 16-bit signed integer |
| `u8` | 8-bit unsigned integer |
| `u16` | 16-bit unsigned integer |
| `u32` | 32-bit unsigned integer |
| `u64` | 64-bit unsigned integer |

### Notes
- `int`/`uint` use the platform default size (typically 64-bit).
- `byte` is an alias of `u8`.
- Support arithmetic and comparison operators for each type.
